# 11. Personal Web Page Generator
# Write a program that asks the user for his or her name, then asks the user to enter a sentence that describes himself or herself. Here is an example of the programâ€™s screen:
# Enter your name: Julie Taylor Enter
# Describe yourself: I am a computer science major, a member of the
# Jazz club, and I hope to work as a mobile app developer after I
# graduate. Enter
# Once the user has entered the requested input, the program should create an HTML file,
# containing the input, for a simple Web page. Here is an example of the HTML content,
# using the sample input previously shown:
# <html>
# <head>
# </head>
# <body>
#  <center>
#  <h1>Julie Taylor</h1>
#  </center>
#  <hr />
#  I am a computer science major, a member of the Jazz club,
#  and I hope to work as a mobile app developer after I graduate.
#  <hr />
# </body>
# </html>
