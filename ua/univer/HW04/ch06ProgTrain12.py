# 12. Average Steps Taken
# A Personal Fitness Tracker is a wearable device that tracks your physical activity, calories
# burned, heart rate, sleeping patterns, and so on. One common physical activity that most
# of these devices track is the number of steps you take each day.
# If you have downloaded this bookâ€™s source code from the Premium Companion Website,
# you will find a file named steps.txt in the Chapter 06 folder. (The Premium Companion
# Website can be found at www.pearsonglobaleditions.com/gaddis.) The steps.txt file
# contains the number of steps a person has taken each day for a year. There are 365 lines
# in the file, and each line contains the number of steps taken during a day. (The first line is
# the number of steps taken on January 1st, the second line is the number of steps taken on
# January 2nd, and so forth.) Write a program that reads the file, then displays the average
# number of steps taken for each month. (The data is from a year that was not a leap year,
# so February has 28 days.)
