# 1. Assume choice references a string. The following if statement determines whether
# choice is equal to ‘Y’ or ‘y’:
# if choice == 'Y' or choice == 'y':
#  Rewrite this statement so it only makes one comparison, and does not use the or
# operator. (Hint: use either the upper or lower methods.)

if choice.lower() == 'y':
