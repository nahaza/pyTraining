# 5. Charge Account Validation
# If you have downloaded the source code from the Premium Companion Website you will
# find a file named charge_accounts.txt in the Chapter 07 folder. This file has a list of a
# companyâ€™s valid charge account numbers. Each account number is a seven-digit number,
# such as 5658845.
# Write a program that reads the contents of the file into a list. The program should then
# ask the user to enter a charge account number. The program should determine whether
# the number is valid by searching for it in the list. If the number is in the list, the program
# should display a message indicating the number is valid. If the number is not in the list, the
# program should display a message indicating the number is invalid.
